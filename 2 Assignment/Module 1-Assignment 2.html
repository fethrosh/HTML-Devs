	<h2 class = "sport">Favorite Sport</h2>
	<div class="sport">My favorite sport, maybe unsurprisingly, is chess. However,
						<strong>my</strong> reason for liking this sport is not what one 
						usually thinks about when thinking about someone who is interested
						in it. My main reason for liking the sport of chess is that I am 
						able to keep it as a background for when I am writing a story. 
						Don't get me wrong, chess is an interesting thing to watch, but I 
						believe there is no way for me to do as well as the people playing 
						the game. As such, it isn't something that I enjoy participating in, 
						but rather something that I like watching happen. Although I 
						feel like everyone knows the rule to chess, I will go over them here
						Certain pieces move certain ways:
						<pre>
	The <strong>knight</strong> can move in an <ins>L shape</ins>.
	The <strong>pawn</strong> can only move forward <ins>1 open space</ins> after it's first move, but up to <ins>2 open spaces</ins> for it's first.
	The <strong>queen</strong> can move in an <ins>unlimited amount</ins> of open spaces diagonally or along the board.
	The <strong>bishop</strong> can move an <ins>unlimited amount</ins> of open spaces diagonally.
	The <strong>rook</strong> can move an <ins>unlimited amount</ins> of open spaces along the board
	The <strong>king</strong> can move only <ins>1 open space</ins> in any direction.
	All pieces <strong>except</strong> the pawn can capture any piece in their way, but stop on that spot. The pawn captures diagonally 1 space.

	<h2 class = "poem">Favorite Poem</h2>
	<pre class = "poem">
Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,
And sorry I could not travel both
And be one traveler, long I stood
And looked down one as far as I could
To where it bent in the undergrowth;

Then took the other, as just as fair,
And having perhaps the better claim,
Because it was grassy and wanted wear;
Though as for that the passing there
Had worn them really about the same,

And both that morning equally lay
In leaves no step had trodden black.
Oh, I kept the first for another day!
Yet knowing how way leads on to way,
I doubted if I should ever come back.

I shall be telling this with a sigh
Somewhere ages and ages hence:
Two roads diverged in a wood, and Iâ€”
I took the one less traveled by,
And that has made all the difference.

	<h2 class="misc">Miscellaneous</h2>
	<div class="misc">Don't know how interesting this will be to whoever's reading this, but I am very interested
	in <abbr title="Constructed Languages">ConLangs</abbr>. I don't know when I started being interested in them, 
	but they've always been the closest thing to a complete creative process for me, since I have had very little 
	opportunity to have a creative outlet other than stories. One of my favorite words from the languages that I 
	have created is <dfn>tevugarl</dfn>, which means fish. Kinda a wierd thing to like about a language, I know, I know. 
	On the other hand, there is nothing more important to someone who is a fisherman, so I guess it's a matter of perspective</div>
