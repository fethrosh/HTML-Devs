		<h2>Favorite Poem</h2>
		<pre>
Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,
And sorry I could not travel both
And be one traveler, long I stood
And looked down one as far as I could
To where it bent in the undergrowth;

Then took the other, as just as fair,
And having perhaps the better claim,
Because it was grassy and wanted wear;
Though as for that the passing there
Had worn them really about the same,

And both that morning equally lay
In leaves no step had trodden black.
Oh, I kept the first for another day!
Yet knowing how way leads on to way,
I doubted if I should ever come back.

I shall be telling this with a sigh
Somewhere ages and ages hence:
Two roads diverged in a wood, and Iâ€”
I took the one less traveled by,
And that has made all the difference.

		<h2>Miscellaneous</h2>
		<div>Don't know how interesting this will be to whoever's reading this, but I am very interested
		in <abbr title="Constructed Languages">ConLangs</abbr>. I don't know when I started being interested in them, 
		but they've always been the closest thing to a complete creative process for me, since I have had very little 
		opportunity to have a creative outlet other than stories. One of my favorite words from the languages that I 
		have created is <dfn>tevugarl</dfn>, which means fish. Kinda a wierd thing to like about a language, I know, I know. 
		On the other hand, there is nothing more important to someone who is a fisherman, so I guess it's a matter of perspective</div>
